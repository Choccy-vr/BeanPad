# June 09: Started PCB & Project

- Decided on using an RP2040 might change it down the road to add buletooth would have to do more research on it though.

- I finished the first version of the main module schematic

**Time Spent: 3h**

- I finished the PCB took a pretty long time relaxing though.

**Time Spent: 3h**

##### **Total Time Spent: 6h**

# June 10th: Case & PCB

- For some reason I didn't think to put mounting holes on the PCB so I added those

- Started up Fusion 360 and time to start on the case.

**Total Time Spent: 5h**

# June 11th: Case

- I finished a early prototype of the case which is good but ...

- I need to wait till after I get the connectors to do final measurements had to kinda guess for right now

- I got done I would call V0.1 so I would count it as a success 

- This concludes hardware for the main module on to software

# June 12th & 13th: Firmware

- I forgot to journal yesterday but I just researched the diffrent firmware options

- I landed on kmk and circuit python might have to change it though.

**Time Spent: 1.5h**

### June 13th:

- Started working on coding the firmware

- I am abosuloutley loving kmk; circuit python not so much

**Time Spent: 2.5h**

**Total Time spent 4h**

# June 14th: Modules!

- First I changed the Base Module PCB to rearrange and fix some things

- I then Finished the Base Module CAD design and edited it to account for the new PCB

- Forgot to mention that I researched and planned all the modules. Right now there will be 4 module:
  
  - Base Module (REQUIRED)
  
  - Knobs
  
  - Macro
  
  - Num-Pad

- I then finished the Knobs Module

- Overall great work day.

**Total TIme spent: 6.5h**
