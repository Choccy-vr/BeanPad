# June 09: Started PCB & Project

- Decided on using an RP2040 might change it down the road to add buletooth would have to do more research on it though.

- I finished the first version of the main module schematic

**Time Spent: 3h**

- I finished the PCB took a pretty long time relaxing though.

**Time Spent: 3h**

##### **Total Time Spent: 6h**

# June 10th: Case & PCB

- For some reason I didn't think to put mounting holes on the PCB so I added those

- Started up Fusion 360 and time to start on the case.

**Total Time Spent: 5h**

# June 11th: Case

- I finished a early prototype of the case which is good but ...

- I need to wait till after I get the connectors to do final measurements had to kinda guess for right now

- I got done I would call V0.1 so I would count it as a success 

- This concludes hardware for the main module on to software
